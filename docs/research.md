# Research Profile

## Biography

I'm Bryan Tan, a compiler engineer currently working in the industry. I
graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2021 with a Master's degree in Computer
Science. While I was at UCSB, I worked with Prof. Yu Feng on several research
projects related to program verification for domain-specific languages. I
currently work at Veridise, Inc., where I am involved in some research projects
involving static analysis and formal verification of DSLs involving financial
applications and zero knowledge proof circuits.

My research interests include type systems, program analysis, and program
verification, especially in applications to domain-specific problems. I also
have side interests in compiler construction techniques, program synthesis, and
functional programming.
