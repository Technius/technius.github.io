# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past.

## Xournal++

[Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io) is an open source, cross-platform
note-taking program implemented in C++ using GTK 3. It is primarily used for
taking hand-written notes via a stylus, but it also supports LaTeX, audio
recordings, and text annotations. Xournal++ can also be used to annotate PDF
files.

I have been one of the primary maintainers of Xournal++ since early 2019: in
addition to fixing bugs and implementing new features, I also triage issues,
manage the build configuration, and create new releases.

## SimPL

[SimPL](https://github.com/Technius/simpl/) is a toy imperative programming
language with some features inspired by functional programming (see the README
for details on what the language is like). It has a compiler (implemented in
Haskell) that targets LLVM. I started working on SimPL because I wanted to learn
how to implement a compiler for a functional language, though I later lost
interest in it.

## Tempget

[Tempget](https://github.com/Technius/tempget) is a cross-platform, parallel
file downloader written in Rust. I wrote this because I got annoyed at having to
write shell scripts to download files.
