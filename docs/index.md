## About Me

I'm Bryan Tan, a software engineer with a love for programming language theory.
In my day job, I help develop static analysis and formal verification tools at
Veridise. Previously, I worked at AWS Annapurna Labs on compilers for machine
learning hardware accelerators. I have a variety of interests, but I am most
excited about functional programming, programming language theory, and
compilers. Check out my [blog](blog) or my
[research profile page](research.md) to get a glimpse of what I like to do!

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Technius) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-tan-08153079). I'm also reachable
by email at `bryantan (AT) technius (DOT) net`.
