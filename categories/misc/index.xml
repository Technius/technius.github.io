      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Bryan Tan, a first-year Computing major at UC Santa Barbara with a love for computer science and technology. In particular, I enjoy writing and refining code to be as elegant as possible. Check out my posts to get a glimpse of what I like to do!

      <description>Obligatory hello world post.
I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a blog again , but this time, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on actually posting stuff! This time, the goal is to improve my writing skills; though my grammar is quite good, I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at writing anything other than directions, code, or technical explanations (though I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up spending most of my time on these types of writing). In particular, I have a really hard time putting essays together.</description>
