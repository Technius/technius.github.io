_Obligatory hello world post._

I'm setting up a blog again , but this time, I'm planning on actually posting
stuff! This time, the goal is to improve my writing skills; though my grammar is
quite good, I'm terrible at writing anything other than directions, code, or
technical explanations (though I'll _probably_ end up spending most of my time
on these types of writing). In particular, I have a _really_ hard time putting
essays together. I'm going to use this blog to practice.

Currently, I'm trying to figure out a nice, declarative, type-safe way to write
a game engine in Scala. There's a lot of interesting ways to approach it, but
I've settled on a hybrid mutable/immutable approach: the mutable part is just to
avoid allocations that'll clog up the garbage collector, and the immutable part
will make automated testing feasible. I've been intermittently working on this
idea for almost a year now, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what I'll
end up with.

I'm also trying to learn Rust. Seriously, Rust is a really cool language.  It's
fast (as in runtime), has a strong type system, and includes a lot of convenient
features like pattern matching and typeclasses. I'll be uploading a little
calculator program written in Rust in a short while; feel free to check it out!

In any case, stay tuned for more! I'll try to publish at least once-a-month, but
I can't make any guarantees.
