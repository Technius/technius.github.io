# Research Profile

## Biography

I'm Bryan Tan, a compiler engineer currently working in the industry. I
graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2021 with a Master's degree in Computer
Science. While I was at UCSB, I worked with Prof. Yu Feng on several research
projects related to program verification for domain-specific languages. I
currently do not have any plans to rejoin academia, although I am still open to
collaborating on research projects (subject to corporate legal approval).

My research interests include type systems, program analysis, and program
verification, especially in applications to domain-specific problems. I also
have side interests in compiler construction techniques, program synthesis, and
functional programming.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at `bryantan (AT) technius
