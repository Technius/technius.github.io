## About Me

I'm Bryan Tan, a computer science student with a love for software engineering
and theoretical computer science. I have a variety of interests, but I am most
excited about functional programming, programming language theory, and
compilers. Check out my posts to get a glimpse of what I like to do!

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/Technius).
